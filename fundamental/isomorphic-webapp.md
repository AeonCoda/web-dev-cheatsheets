## What is isomophic Webapp

When you create a webpage, there will be static content and there will be dynamic content.

Static content is stuff on the webpage that will not change. For example, the topnav and the footer are things that are static.

Dynamic content is stuff that changes after the DOM has loaded. For example, push notifications.

Isomorphic webapp means have server side rendering for the static content and single page applications rendering dynamic content.

### Why is server side rendering useful?**

**Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**
> server side rendering is ideal for SEO.

Bots and crawlers can read all of the data on page load. We need good SEO to maximize the number of people that come to the app from search engines. Single-page applications are difficult for search engine bots to crawl because they donâ€™t load the data for the app until after the JavaScript has run in the browser.

Google tools for assessing your app for SEO

* Use Google Speed Insight Tool to assess speed of your web page:

* Use Google lighthouse for an in depth anaysis: [https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)* Build a progressive webapp to improve usability for the mobile version of your webpage.

* Use Audit in Chrome's devtools. Build a progressive Web Apps take advantage of new technologies to bring the best of mobile sites & native apps to users. Read [Progressive Webapps with React](https://medium.com/@addyosmani/progressive-web-apps-with-react-js-part-i-introduction-50679aef2b12).

**Speed and Accessibility**

Loading a SPA can be a slow experience for a user (especially on mobile phones).

Faster and improved accessibility because the user can view the app without JavaScript.

## React

> React takes advantage of functional concepts by adhering to single direction data flows from the top level component down to its children. What makes it appealing for isomorphic apps is how it uses a virtual DOM to manage changes and updates to the application
